    **Instructions**:
    1. Upload an Excel file with columns:
       - **Name**  
       - **Handle**  (unique identifier)  
       - **Faction**  
       - **Tags**  
       - **TwHandle** (optional)  
       - **TwFollowers** (desired # of followers)  
       - **TwFollowing** (desired # of followings)  

    2. Set the probabilities below:
       - **Country-Specific Hub Probability**: if \u201C#hub_xxx\u201D in V's tags and \u201C#xxx\u201D in U's tags  
       - **Global Hub Probability**: if V is tagged as \u201C#hub\u201D (international hub)  
       - **Intra-Faction Probability**: if neither is a hub, but U and V share the same faction  
       - **Inter-Faction Probability**: if neither is a hub and U and V are in different factions  

    3. The app will create a synthetic "who-follows-whom" graph that tries to match each userâ€™s follower/following counts.  

    4. Finally, it ensures that each user follows at least 2 others and is followed by at least 2 others.  

    5. Scroll down to see a table of edges and an interactive network diagram.
